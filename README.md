# SSD-Assignment-2

1. Copy project folder 'SSD' to Xampp 'htdocs' folder. 

2. Run Xampp

3. Start Apache server
	    Make sure the Xampp Apache server is configured to access https instead of http.
	    because new Facebook Graph API policies require https.
      
4. Run the application using 'localhost/SSD/'

5. Login to the application using the test account.
	    Because of Facebook policies about 3rd party application development, 
    	any developed third-party application needs to be gone through a reviewing process before it becomes open to the public. 
	    Therefore, the application that didn’t went through the review process can only be login by using testing accounts registered by developers of the application. 
	    Therefore, we have created a testing Facebook account in order for others to test this web application.
	
	    Testing account username – dlassignment2@gmail.com
	    Testing account password – Dl@ssignment2
